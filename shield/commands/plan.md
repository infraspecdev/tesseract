# Plan

Generate Shield plan documents with a machine-readable sidecar.

## Usage

`/plan [--name <plan-name>] [topic or requirements]`

## Output Paths — MANDATORY

First, find the project root by locating `.shield.json` (check current directory, then parent directories). Read the `output_dir` field from `.shield.json` (default: `docs/shield` if not set). Then write each artifact using the Write tool to:

1. `{project_root}/{output_dir}/{feature-name}-YYYYMMDD/plan.json` — machine-readable sidecar (updated in place at feature root)
2. `{project_root}/{output_dir}/{feature-name}-YYYYMMDD/plan/{N}-{slug}/architecture.html` — the "why and how"
3. `{project_root}/{output_dir}/{feature-name}-YYYYMMDD/plan/{N}-{slug}/plan.html` — the "what to do", rendered from the sidecar
4. `{project_root}/{output_dir}/index.html` — single dashboard linking to all artifacts (create or update)

Where:
- `{output_dir}` = the `output_dir` value from `.shield.json` (default: `docs/shield`)
- `{feature-name}` = derived from `--name` or topic in kebab-case
- `YYYYMMDD` = current date
- `{N}` = run number, determined by counting existing folders in `{feature-name}-YYYYMMDD/plan/` + 1
- `{slug}` = the plan name in kebab-case

If `--name` is not provided, derive from the topic in kebab-case. Example: `/plan input validation` → feature folder `input-validation-20260319/`.

Replace `{project_root}` with the absolute path to the directory containing `.shield.json`.

**Do NOT** use a relative path. **Do NOT** use the plugin directory. **Do NOT** invent custom filenames. **Do NOT** delegate to superpowers or other skills that write to different paths. The Write tool creates directories automatically.

## Behavior

1. If topic/requirements provided, use as starting context
2. If no topic, ask the user what they're planning
3. Read `output_dir` from `.shield.json` (default: `docs/shield`)
4. If `--name` not provided, derive from topic in kebab-case
5. Feature folder = `{plan-name}-YYYYMMDD`
6. Determine run number by counting existing folders in `{output_dir}/{feature}/plan/` + 1
7. Check for prior research: glob for `{project_root}/{output_dir}/{feature}/research/*/findings.md` and read the most recent one if it exists
8. **Generate `{feature}/plan.json` first** — the sidecar JSON with epics, stories, tasks, and acceptance criteria. See the `shield:plan-docs` skill for the schema.
9. **Generate architecture HTML** — the "why and how" document
10. **Generate plan HTML** — stories rendered from the sidecar, includes `<meta name="sidecar" content="../plan.json">`
11. **Update `manifest.json`** in `{output_dir}/` and **regenerate `index.html`** — single dashboard linking to all artifacts
12. **You MUST produce all four artifacts and write them to the paths above.** No exceptions.
13. Verify the sidecar JSON contains at least 1 epic with stories, each with acceptance criteria
14. Offer next steps:
    - `/plan-review` — run multi-agent review on the plan
    - `/pm-sync` — sync stories to project management tool
